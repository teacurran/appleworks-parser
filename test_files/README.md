test files
==========

This directory contains a set of test files that were generated from the following versions of appleworks:

OSX

* 6.2.9

Windows

* 5.0v1

The documents briefly are:

* Alice in Wonderland with different formats and lengths
* blank documents
* The quick brown fox text with different styles applied
* lorem ipsum

If a document has two versions in the file name it means it was converted from one to another.

For example:
brownfoxstyle_5.0v1_win-6.2.9_osx.cwk

was a document that was originally created in 5.0v1 on windows and converted to 6.2.9 on OSX.
